# ðŸ§ª Practice Hub

Welcome to my personal coding playground. This repository contains all the small projects, exercises, and practice code I've written while learning web development, Python, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Exists

I believe that consistent practice beats perfection. This repo is a living journal of my journey to becoming a strong software engineer.

ðŸŒ± Work in Progress
This is not a portfolio â€” itâ€™s proof of effort. Some projects may be messy. Thatâ€™s the point. Iâ€™m showing up daily to improve.
